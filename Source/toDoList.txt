This is a to-do list of features that I am procrastinating to do.

-Separate the tools class to multiple classes
-The insert Circle() function will run forever if the image is blank... maybe you should fix this huh.
-Make test cases to prove your functions still work in the testall.cpp file.

Immediate things to do
-Make the que prioritize bigger circles.
-Delete nodes that are waaaaaay too close when looking where to grow
-Find the bug that makes the program crash
-Do not connect circles that intersect over the original shape.
